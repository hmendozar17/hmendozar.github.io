## Random Number Functions

- R has a number of built-in functions associated with specific distributions.
- These provide the density, distribution, and quantile functions ofeach distribution as well as generating random numbers from them.
- Example: the normal family

**dnorm** Normal density.

**pnorm** Cumulative normal density.

**qnorm** Normal quantiles (q(p) ={u:P(xâ‰¤u) =p})

**rnorm** Generates normal random numbers.

- **Example:** dnorm, pnorm, and qnorm

```{r}
# Sequence of numbers
x = seq(-3,3,0.1)  
# Plot window with 2-by-2 panes filled by row.
par(mfrow=c(2,2))  

plot(x,dnorm(x,mean=0,sd=1),type='l',col="blue",main="f(x):X~N(mean=0,sd=1)")
plot(x,pnorm(x,mean=0,sd=1),type='l',col="blue",main="F(x):X~N(mean=0,sd=1)")
# probabilities between 0 and 1
p = seq(0,1,0.01) 
plot(p,qnorm(p,mean=0,sd=1),type='l',col="blue")

z = rnorm(100,mean=3,sd=5)
plot(z,col="blue")

```
- **rnorm**
```{r}
x<-rnorm(100000,mean=10, sd=2)
hist(x,breaks=150,xlim=c(0,20),freq=FALSE)
abline(v=c(mean(x)), lwd=3,lty=3,col="red")
```
- Normal distribution with mean o and variance 1
```{r}
x <- seq(-3, 3, length=1000)
y <- dnorm(x, mean=0, sd=1)
plot(x, y, type="l", lwd=1,col="red")

```

## The sample Function
Sometimes you want to randomly select elements from a set

```{r}
# Population
  y = sqrt(1:10)
# Random sample of size n=5 
  z = sample(x=y,size=5)  
```
If sample is given **n** instead of **x**, it assumes **1:n**
%This will be useful on Homework 1.
```{r}
sample(x=10,size=5)

```

You can also sample **with replacement**. This means each time you choose from the original collection and  can get repeated elements:

```{r}
sample(x=y,5,replace=TRUE) 
```
- **In-Class ACTIVITY**

```{r}
# Write the code to select a sample of size 5 from a business with 20 employees.
# Write the names of the employees
```

## Chapter 14-15-16: Simulation
- Why do statisticians need to generate random numbers at all?
1. To investigate the sample properties of complex statistical procedures

2. To investigate the sample properties of complex statistical procedures. %To torture students.

3. To verify mathematical results (e.g. the square of a normal is a $\chi^2_1$)

4. To assess convergence to asymptotic results (eg, central limit theorem).

5. Within some statistical procedures (later in the course).


## Chapter 14-15-16: Evaluating the Central Limit Theorem}

 We know that if $X_1,X_2,\ldots$ are i.i.d. with mean $\mu$ and variance $\sigma^2$, but no other conditions
\[
\sqrt{n} \left(\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n X_i - \mu \right) \stackrel{d}{\rightarrow} N(0,\sigma^2)
\]


But how close is this for a given, finite $n$?


## Chapter 14-15-16:Example for a negative binomial random variable

-  suppose we had three negative binomial random variables with $r=1$ and $p = 0.07$?


- Negative Binomial (or Pascal) Distribution

We say $X \sim NB(r,p)$ if the probability mass function of $X$ is   
 
	$$P(X=k) =   {k+r-1 \choose k}p^{r}(1-p)^{k}$$

	for $k=0, 1, 2, \ldots$.

-  $X$ denotes the number of Failures till the $r$th Success; and $p$ is the probability of Success. 
-  Sometimes: the number of failures which occur in a sequence of Bernoulli trials before a target number of successes is reached
- The total number of Bernoulli trials is $Z+r$.
- $E(X) = \frac{(1-p)r}{p}$ and $Var(X) = \frac{(1-p)r}{p^2}$
- $r=1$: Geometric Distribution


```{r}
x.nbinom = rnbinom(500,1,0.05)
hist(x.nbinom,50,freq=FALSE)

x.nbinom= seq(0,100,5)
lines(x.nbinom,dnbinom(x.nbinom,1,0.07),
type='b',col='blue')
```

## A Simulation Experiment


-  Recall that for $r=1$, $E X = \frac{1-p}{p} = 13.286$, $\mbox{Var}(X) = \frac{1-p}{p^2} = 189.796$. 



```{r}
nsim = 500              # Define simulation parameters
n = 3
p = 0.07
mu = (1-p)/p
sig = sqrt( (1-p)/p^2 )

res = rep(0,nsim)

for(i in 1:nsim){        # Run Simulations
  Z = rnbinom(n,1,p)
  res[i] = sqrt(n)/sig*( mean(Z) - mu )
}

hist(res,50,freq=FALSE)  # Plot Results
x = seq(-3,3,0.1)
lines(x,dnorm(x))
```

## Some Comments On Good Simulation Code

- Pre-define as many simulation constants into R objects as possible.

- This way, to change the simulation (eg, if we wanted to change $p$), we only
need to do so in one place.

- Pre-compute numbers that will be used many times $\mu$ and $\sigma$ above).

- Store as much as possible; you never know when you will need it.

- Ideally, you can re-create **exactly** the same results from your simulation if you need to (I maybe should have stored all the Z that I generated).


## Some More Comments On Good Code

- Further general guidelines:

- Organize your code in coherent .R files (functions related to a particular task, simulations for a particular set of results).

- Provide an overall description at the start of the file - what is this code doing?

- Date the last time you modified the code -- even better, keep a running log of changes you have made.

-  Arrange your code into coherent blocks; reading/generating data, running the simulation, collating results and make sure these are clearly separated and labeled.

-  When you save simulation results (including plots from them), include as much information in the file name as possible (esp. the date); keep a file documenting exactly what each of these results means and contains.

-  Comment everything!


## Larger $n$

Because I pre-defined **n=3**, it's easy to change it to 30, 100, 500.

## SHORTCUT IN R

- **Jump to Line command:** Keyboard shortcut: Alt+Shift+G (Mac: Option+Shift+Cmd+G).
- to run current Chunk,  Mac: Shift+Cmd+return.
- Mac: Opt+Cmd+I to insert a chunk
